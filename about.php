         <h2><strong>About ATMAT</strong></h2>
         <p>A brief history of how we made it here</p>
       </div>

       <p><strong>Driven</strong> by the desire to seek knowledge wherever in the world it is, Azerbaijani
       students have often moved to Australia during the last two decades. Although their
       number is modest, it has been enough to come together and make a mark in Australia.</p>

       <p><strong>The 2000s</strong> saw the first big wave of students from Azerbaijan. However, most of them
       moved back overseas and struggles of life in migration kept the other ones busy. Remarkable
       student activities during this period were limited to isolated events.</p>

       <p><strong>In</strong> the following decade, with a rise in popularity of Australian education, as well as
       the commencement of the state scholarship program for education abroad for Azerbaijanis,
       increasing number of Azerbaijani students started arriving in Australia. A group from among
       these students built a strong relationship (with some of them sharing accommodation),
       which formed the core of today&#39;s network of Azerbaijani students and alumni of Australian universities.</p>

       <p><strong>In</strong> the early days of 2013, when Azerbaijani students from New South Wales, Queensland, as
       well as New Zealand came together for the Christmas holidays, the necessity of forming into
       a formal organisation surfaced. Later that year, Azerbaijani Embassy to Australia was opened
       in Canberra, which supported this idea. After thorough discussions and legal research, the application
       for incorporation of Azerbaijani Students&#39; and Graduates&#39; Organisation in Australia was filed in 2014.</p>

       <p><strong>22 May, 2014</strong> is the birth date of ATMAT.<br /><br />
       <strong>The vast</strong> amount of effort generously put by the volunteers for the benefit of this organisation (and,
       consequently, for the benefit of all Azerbaijani students in Australia) has resulted in organisation
       of various get-togethers, BBQ&#39;, sporting events, celebration of Azerbaijani national holidays and
       much more, which can be found on the <a href="">News page</a>.</p>
